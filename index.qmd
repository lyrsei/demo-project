The phytobiome is an important component of plant health and reproductive success.

The following data set was was sourced from an article on Dryad. It explores the possibility of adding a synthetic microbial consortium to tomatoes *Solanum lycopersicum* in a greenhouse setting where microbe recruitment could be disrupted.

The added microbial associations named PhylloStart were found to improve plant reproductive success.

This experiment was conducted through 3 trials.
