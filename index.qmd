title: "Phyllosphere microbial associations and plant reproductive success"
---

The phyllosphere plant microbiome is an important component of Plant-Microbe systems. The following data set was was sourced from an article on Dryad. It explores the possibility of adding a synthetic microbial consortium to tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) in a greenhouse settings where microbe recruitment could be disrupted.
The added phyllosphere microbial associations was found to improve plant reproductive success.

Trial 1:

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
#| echo: FALSE

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

file_path <- "C:/Users/LENOVO/Documents/Desktop/projects/phyllosphere-microbiome/data/Trial_1_Greenhouse_Bacterial_Abundance.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)

p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Sample_ID, y = TotalAbundance, fill = Treatment, text = TotalAbundance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Bacterial Abundance in Greenhouse Samples",
       x = "Sample",
       y = "Total Abundance",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Convert ggplot to an interactive plotly plot
interactive_plot <- ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")

# Add a customized title with HTML for italics
interactive_plot <- interactive_plot %>% layout(
  title = htmltools::HTML("Bacterial Abundance in Greenhouse Samples (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>)")
)

# Show the interactive plot
