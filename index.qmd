title: "Phyllosphere microbial associations and plant reproductive success"
---

The phyllosphere plant microbiome is an important component of Plant-Microbe systems. The following data set was was sourced from an article on Dryad. It explores the possibility of adding a synthetic microbial consortium to tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) in a greenhouse settings where microbe recruitment could be disrupted.
The added phyllosphere microbial associations was found to improve plant reproductive success.
