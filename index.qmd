The phyllosphere plant microbiome is an important component of plant health and reproductive success. The following data set was was sourced from an article on Dryad. It explores the possibility of adding a synthetic microbial consortium to tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) in a greenhouse settings where microbe recruitment could be disrupted.
