Trial 1 focused on examining the initial interactions and colonization patterns of bacterial communities on the phyllosphere. This study utilized a controlled greenhouse setting to observe the establishment and development of these communities under different bacterial treatments.

The plants were inoculated with PhylloStart bacterial consortium at an optical density of 0.02. Leaf samples were collected in Week 8 to analyze the impact of the inoculations on the phyllosphere microbiome.

# Convert ggplot object to plotly object

# Modify the layout to adjust the title position and font size
p1 <- p1 %>% layout(
  title = list(
    text = "Bacterial Abundance in Greenhouse Samples of <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>",
    x = 0,  # Adjust the x position to move title to the left (0 is left-aligned)
    xanchor = 'left',  # Anchor the title text to the left
    font = list(size = 20),  # Set the font size to 20 (adjust as needed)
    margin = list(t = 100)
  )
)

```

The leaves of non-PhylloStart treated greenhouse plants have low bacterial abundance.
